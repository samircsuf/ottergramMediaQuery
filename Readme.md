Assignment 4 - Spring 2017

Section 2 due February 27.  Section 1 due March 1.

In this assignment, you will finish the Ottergram app and write some new JavaScript to add additional features.

Complete the following:

1.Work through Chapter 7.  Verify that you can toggle between showing and hiding the detail image, and that both visual effects are in place.

2.In the current version of Ottergram, the detail image is changed when a thumbnail is clicked.  Users who prefer the keyboard can select thumbnails and trigger clicks using the Tab and Enter keys, but the interaction is awkward.

Use JavaScript to add the ability to select a thumbnail and change the detail image by pressing a digit key (e.g., '1' to select Barry, and '5' to select Barbara in the default layout).

Do not hard-code key-to-thumbnail mappings -- if the order or number of images changes, your code should continue to function correctly (at least for the first 9 thumbnails).

3.Push the contents of your ottergram directory into a new public GitHub repository.
